# Blueprints Extensions

Blueprints extensions contain additional interfaces, drivers, and utilities that build on top the standard Blueprints package.

## Interfaces
- Additional Graph interfaces with methods that are useful for benchmarking and bulk updates

## Drivers
- Wrappers around the standard Neo4j and DEX Blueprints implementations that provide enhanced functionality
- Simple BerkeleyDB-based and SQL-based Blueprints implementations

## Utilities
- Libraries and tools for reading and writing the Fast Graph Format (FGF)
- A faster version of the GraphML loader (at the cost of extra memory overhead)
